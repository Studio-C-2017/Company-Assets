# Studio C 2017 Website
This is the Studio C Class of 2017 website. It contains an about page, a contact page, examples of previous work for potential clients to look at, and short bios for every member of Studio C.

## Installation
If you have git installed on your computer, simply cloning the repository into any directory will suffice: `git clone github.com/studio-c-2017/<name of the repository>.git`. Otherwise, download the zip file. As the website is HTML/CSS/JS, this website can be run locally in any web browser.

### WordPress
This guide assumes you already have WordPress installed on a WAMP/MAMP/LAMP server. If you do not know how to install WordPress, refer to the [WordPress Codex's section on Installing WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress). This guide also assumes you feel comfortable using the terminal and are using a BASH shell.

Go to the directory that contains the WordPress site. Inside of the WordPress site, go to the <your-site-name>/wp-content/themes directory ("wp" may have been replaced by the name you set for your site during installation). If you have git installed on your computer, run `git clone github.com/studio-c-2017/<name of the repository>.git` inside of this directory. Otherwise, download the zip file and extract the contents of the zip file into the themes directory. Sign in to the admin area of WordPress. Click on the Appearances tab on the left, and from there you should be able to select the theme.
